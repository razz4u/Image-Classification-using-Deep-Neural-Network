# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Neural-Network
Deep learning for Image Classification.

1. Bulid a Image Classifier using Depp Neural Network for Cat and Dog image classification.
2. Used Tensorflow`s keras library for construction Depp Neural Network
3. This project was build on Google`s Co-laboratory to utilize the GPUs.
4. In this project the images are store/retrieved from pickle file.
